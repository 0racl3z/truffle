You can now specify/configure compilers in the truffle config! This includes
being able to specify a particular version or release of solc in addition to
support for Vyper.  Configuration of external compilers is also now supported!

{"gitdown": "include", "file": "./features/compile/solc.md"}
{"gitdown": "include", "file": "./features/compile/external.md"}
{"gitdown": "include", "file": "./features/compile/config.md"}

For more information on configuring the compilers, see the [docs](https://truffleframework.com/docs/truffle/reference/configuration#compiler-configuration).
