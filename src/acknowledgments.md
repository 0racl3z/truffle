The Truffle team would like to single out a few groups for acknowledgement...

Thank you to the Solidity team for the recent release of v0.5.0 and all their continued great work.  Their efforts have enabled this ecosystem to thrive!

Thanks to Web3.js!  The release of v1.0 allowed for some amazing improvements to Truffle which have contributed to a much better user experience!

We'd like to also thank the Colony team which has used version 5 since the very beginning.  Their invaluable feedback has helped us to create a much more usable and stable version of Truffle.

And our task would have been a lot more difficult without the help of all of you wonderful Truffle users! Thanks for all of the bug reports and always reminding us about the things we forget.

We also hit a milestone with this release of Truffle: version 5 has included more contributions from external contributors than any other major release!  So thank you to everyone who contributed and helped us make Truffle great!
